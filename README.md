welcome 
my first repository.
This src code allows you to warn the player if the player has entered the server from a version where there may be significant problems, from visual to technical, which can lead to a crash from the game.

I strongly recommend that you do not use this source code unless you have a proxy server
In the event that you are already using a plugin that uses titles at the beginning of the game, then problems may arise
